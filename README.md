What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The project involved creating an advising assistance program for academic advisors at ABCU. The goal was to manage course data efficiently, print sorted course lists, and retrieve specific course details, including prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
We designed a system using a binary search tree (BST) to efficiently manage and query course data. Understanding data structures helped us choose BST because it supports fast insertion, searching, and in-order traversal for automatic sorting.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Challenges included designing a clear file-parsing mechanism and ensuring correct insertion into the BST. Careful debugging, adding clear error messages, and using step-by-step validation helped resolve these issues.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The project reinforced the importance of selecting the right data structure based on the programâ€™s requirements. It also highlighted the significance of breaking down problems into manageable components, making development more systematic and effective.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing modular functions and using meaningful variable names improved code readability and maintainability. Adding inline comments and structuring code logically helped create an adaptable system that can easily accommodate future feature expansions.
